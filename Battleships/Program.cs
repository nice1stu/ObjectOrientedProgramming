/*2 Players
10 x 10 grid per player
Simplified Ship Sizes: Only 5x 1 sized ships
Players take alternating turns
Coordinates given in the form g7, a2, d2 etc...
consider using the numeric value of chars! :)
can be simplified at first with two inputs:
first: int x
then: int y
Feedback "Hit" or "Miss"
Win Condition: All enemy ships have been sunk
Bonus Rules (A*):
Ships: sizes 5, 4, 3, 2 ships with 2
Ships may be placed vertically or horizontally
Ships may not overlap and may not touch each other (i.e. there needs to be at least 1 empty grid cell around the ship in every direction)
Feedback "Ship sunk!"
Bonus Bonus (No score):
A.I.? :)
Radar Power Up
Can be used to detect ships in a 3x3 radius around the location placed (but not hit them)
Can you think of other power-ups? :)
Scanner Power Up
Can be used to scan a 3x3 radius around the location placed
Only returns "Ship detected" or "No ship detected"*/
